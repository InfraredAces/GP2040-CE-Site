# Modifying Gamepad State

In any function looking to modify the gamepad state, use a pointer to the gamepad. This is absolutely necessary for changing any aspect of gamepad state.

```cpp
Gamepad *gamepad = Storage::getInstance().GetGamepad();
```

You can find the appropriate gamepad macros and button masks in `headers/gamepad/GamepadState.h`

## Directional Pad

To modify the gamepad's directional pad (DPad) state, use a bitwise OR assignment and the appropriate `GAMEPAD_MASK` enum to set the input as active.

```cpp
Gamepad *gamepad = Storage::getInstance().GetGamepad();
gamepad->state.dpad |= GAMEPAD_MASK_UP;
gamepad->state.dpad |= GAMEPAD_MASK_DOWN;
gamepad->state.dpad |= GAMEPAD_MASK_LEFT;
gamepad->state.dpad |= GAMEPAD_MASK_RIGHT;
```

:::note SOCD Cleaning for Add-ons

All add-ons need to handle opposing simultaneous cardinal directions within the add-on since they come after standard GPIO inputs has already been SOCD cleaned.

Consider using `runSOCDCleaner(SOCDMode mode, uint8_t dpad)` in `src/gamepad/GamepadState.cpp` to take incoming DPad inputs and then resolve them at once in the add-on's `process()` function.

## Buttons

To modify the gamepad's button states, use a bitwise OR assignment and the appropriate `GAMEPAD_MASK` enum to set the input as active.

```cpp
Gamepad *gamepad = Storage::getInstance().GetGamepad();
gamepad->state.buttons |= GAMEPAD_MASK_B1;
gamepad->state.buttons |= GAMEPAD_MASK_B2;
gamepad->state.buttons |= GAMEPAD_MASK_B3;
gamepad->state.buttons |= GAMEPAD_MASK_B4;
gamepad->state.buttons |= GAMEPAD_MASK_L1;
gamepad->state.buttons |= GAMEPAD_MASK_R1;
gamepad->state.buttons |= GAMEPAD_MASK_L2;
gamepad->state.buttons |= GAMEPAD_MASK_R2;
gamepad->state.buttons |= GAMEPAD_MASK_S1;
gamepad->state.buttons |= GAMEPAD_MASK_S2;
gamepad->state.buttons |= GAMEPAD_MASK_L3;
gamepad->state.buttons |= GAMEPAD_MASK_R3;
gamepad->state.buttons |= GAMEPAD_MASK_A1;
gamepad->state.buttons |= GAMEPAD_MASK_A2;
gamepad->state.buttons |= AUX_MASK_FUNCTION;
```

## Joystick

To modify the gamepad's analog joystick state, each joystick's X- and Y-axes must be set to an unsigned integer between 0 and 65535.

```cpp
GAMEPAD_JOYSTICK_MIN = 0
GAMEPAD_JOYSTICK_MID = 0x7FFF
GAMEPAD_JOYSTICK_MAX = 0xFFFF
```

| Axis   | Value Range     | Joystick Position         |
| :----- | :-------------- | :------------------------ |
| X-Axis | 0 - 32767      | Direction Left 100% - 0%  |
| X-Axis | 32767          | Centered                  |
| X-Axis | 32767 - 65535 | Direction Right 0% - 100% |
| Y-Axis | 0 - 32767      | Direction Up 100% - 0%  |
| Y-Axis | 32767          | Centered                  |
| Y-Axis | 32767 - 65535 | Direction Down 0% - 100% |

```cpp
Gamepad *gamepad = Storage::getInstance().GetGamepad();
gamepad->state.ly = value;
gamepad->state.lx = value;
gamepad->state.ry = value:
gamepad->state.rx = value:
```

:::note SOCD Cleaning for Analog Inputs

All add-ons will need to handle opposing simultaneous cardinal directions on the analog joysticks as there are no preexisting mechanisms for resolving such things elsewhere in the firmware.

## Triggers

For the L2 and R2 triggers, there are two different methods for setting the values of the triggers. You can either set them digitally or using analog values.

### Digital Triggers

Similarly to other digital inputs, use a bitwise OR assignment and the appropriate `GAMEPAD_MASK` enum to set the input as active.

```cpp
Gamepad *gamepad = Storage::getInstance().GetGamepad();
gamepad->state.buttons |= GAMEPAD_MASK_L2;
gamepad->state.buttons |= GAMEPAD_MASK_R2;
```

### Analog Triggers

To set the L2 and R2 triggers to analog values, first, the gamepad's flag `hasAnalogTriggers` indicating whether the gamepad has analog triggers must be set to `true`. By default, this flag is set to `false` and it is recommended that you set this flag whenever you are manipulating analog trigger values. 

Then, the appropriate axes should be set for each analog trigger. The values for analog triggers can range from 0 to 255, where 0 is fully released and 255 is fully depressed.

```cpp
GAMEPAD_TRIGGER_MIN = 0;
GAMEPAD_TRIGGER_MID = 0x7F;
GAMEPAD_TRIGGER_MAX = 0xFF;
```

```cpp
Gamepad *gamepad = Storage::getInstance().GetGamepad();
gamepad->hasAnalogTriggers = true;
gamepad->state.lt = value;
gamepad->state.rt = value;
```
