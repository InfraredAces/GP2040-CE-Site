# Building

## Environment Variables

A number of new environment variables have been setup to control parts of the build flow.

| Name               | Default | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GP2040_BOARDCONFIG | Pico    | The boards.h config file to use for the build.                                                          |
| SKIP_WEBBUILD      | FALSE   | Determines whether the web configurator is built during the cmake configuration step.                   |
| SKIP_SUBMODULES    | FALSE   | Determines whether the submodule init command is run automatically during the cmake configuration step. |

### SDK Variables

There are a few SDK variables we take advantage of for our builds.

| Name       | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PICO_BOARD | pico    | This is the embedded board that the RP2040 chip is part of. By default, it assumes the Pico. This variable would match the `<boardname.h>` file in the board's configs folder. |

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems" defaultValue="Windows (Pico SDK)">
<TabItem value="Windows (Pico SDK)" label="Windows (Pico SDK)" default>

After installing the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK, you should now have a shortcut to "Pico-Visual Studio Code" (search for it using Windows Search). This shortcut should already have everything configured, **allowing you to skip to step 7**. If you're experiencing compilation issues, consider following the manual steps outlined here.

Ensure the `PICO_SDK_PATH` environment variable is set:

1. Search for "Edit environment variables for your account" in Windows.
2. Under "User Variables," click "New...".
3. In the dialog that appears, enter `PICO_SDK_PATH` for the Variable Name.
4. Click "Browse Directory" and navigate to `C:\Program Files\Raspberry Pi\Pico SDK v1.5.1\pico-sdk` for the Variable Value.
5. Create another new variable.
6. Enter `GP2040_BOARDCONFIG` for the Variable Name.
7. Enter `Pico` (or the name of your edited config folder) for the Variable Value.

You can also set the variable within VSCode:

1. Press `Ctrl + ,` to open the settings.
2. Use the search bar to find "CMake."
3. Scroll until you see "CMake: Configure Environment."
4. Click "Add Item."
5. Key: `GP2040_BOARDCONFIG`
6. Value: `Pico` (or your working folder name).

When prompted, choose `GCC 10.3.1 ARM NONE EABI` for "Select a kit for GP2040-CE"

From inside VSCode:

1. Click the CMake icon on the left sidebar of VSCode.
2. You'll see three icons at the top-right corner of the CMake project outline. Click the "Configure All Projects" icon (looks like a page with an arrow).
3. Wait for the configuration process to complete. If progress isn't visible, open a new terminal in VSCode by clicking on the "Terminal" menu, then "New Terminal". A new terminal window will open at the bottom, navigate the "Output" tab.
4. Click "Build All Projects" in the CMake project outline.
5. The files should be in a new folder named "build" inside the GP2040-CE folder

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Windows (Manual)" label="Windows (Manual)" default>

Start in the GP2040-CE folder. **From a Developer Powershell or Developer Command Command Prompt**:

:::note

A new Powershell or Command Prompt session will be required after setting an environment variable.

:::

1. Ensure you have the `PICO_SDK_PATH` environment variable set to the path to your pico-sdk folder.
2. (optional) Set the `GP2040_BOARDCONFIG` environment variable to the folder name for your board configuration.

   - Default value is `Pico`

3. Create a build directory, configure the build, and execute the build.

   ```console
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   nmake
   ```

4. Your UF2 file should be in the build directory.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Linux" label="Linux" default>

Start in the GP2040-CE folder

1. Ensure you have the `PICO_SDK_PATH` environment variable set to the path to your pico-sdk folder.
2. (optional) Set the `GP2040_BOARDCONFIG` environment variable to the folder name for your board configuration.
   - Default value is `Pico`
3. Create a build directory, configure the build, and execute the build.

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

4. Your UF2 file should be in the build directory.
